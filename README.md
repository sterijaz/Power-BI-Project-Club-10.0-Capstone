Maven Electronics Power BI Capstone Project

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project was developed as part of the Power BI Bootcamp 10.0 Capstone.
The goal was to design an interactive dashboard for Maven Electronics that provides insights into sales, customers, stores, and product performance.
The project highlights my ability to work with data modeling, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), and data storytelling to turn raw data into actionable insights.
